# Final Project, Data Science 710   
   
Using tweets from Twitter, I analyzed sentiment before and after a patch to the popular MMO Final Fantasy XIV.    
Python code and R code used for the analysis can be found above.     
Files as they were created by code and used are also included if you'd like to do your own analysis.    
For original instructions, see Project Instructions.pdf      
To see my final executed code, refer to FinalProject.pdf   
The executive summary is also included and labeled.    
   
Woo!
